ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average.

An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q

where,

p is the order of the AR term

q is the order of the MA term

d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary

If a time series, has seasonal patterns, then you need to add seasonal terms and it becomes SARIMA, short for ‘Seasonal ARIMA’. More on that once we finish ARIMA.
